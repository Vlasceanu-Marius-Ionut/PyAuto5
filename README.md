Auto Cleanup Script

This Python script automatically cleans temporary files on a Windows system:
Deletes all files from the userâ€™s temp folder and %TEMP%.
Cleans the Windows Prefetch folder as much as possible (ignores locked files).
Shows a "Cleanup done :)" message and a 3-second countdown before exiting.
Works on any Python version, no extra dependencies required.
Safe to run, only removes files that can be safely deleted.
